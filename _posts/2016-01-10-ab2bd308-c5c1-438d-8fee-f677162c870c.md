February 2016 marks the start of this year's LGBT History Month. Now in its 49th year, the month long celebration aims to challenge homophobia, biphobia and transphobia, and this year's theme is set to be 'Religion, Belief and Philosophy'. 

As always, we have our fantastic Theatre in Education performance on offer to link in with LGBT History Month: "Straight Talking -- Putting a STOP to homophobic, biphobic and transphobic bullying in schools".

"Straight Talking" is a Theatre in Education piece that puts a stop to homophobic, biphobic and transphobic language and bullying in schools, and is suitable for ages 11-18\. We have performed this in and around Birmingham for the past three years and it is hugely successful. 

The 30 minute comedy performance is followed by an interactive and exploratory workshop to dispel preconceptions and prejudice against LGBT people. It is a hugely important piece that should be seen by all young people and has recently been endorsed by Denise Welch (Loose Women, Waterloo Road).
Don't forget! We're also still touring our newest performance: "Follow Me -- Tackling Extreme behaviour in young people's society"
