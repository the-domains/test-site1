# Hello, we are Round Midnight! Welcome to our website. 

We are a Birmingham based creative arts company who work hard to provide high quality arts projects for all those we work with. But before you look around and delve into all the fantastic work we have on offer, why not get to know us better first... 

Round Midnight Ltd was established back in 1992 and its sister company Round Midnight Creative Arts (not for profit) was established in 2010\. For almost twenty years we at Round Midnight have provided unique and exciting projects to schools, communities, health and corporate organisations across the UK, enriching skills and building relationships along the way. 

We specialise in drama in schools, performing arts, film and music but also provide visual arts and dance programmes. Our work includes Theatre in Education, a Radio 4 comedy series, a situation comedy, casting workshops and film coaching for the TV and film industry, numerous tours of theatres and comedy venues, school programmes, corporate training and much more. 

So, if you would like to know more about Round Midnight, please take a look around our site or get in touch. We would love to hear from you! 

Best wishes
The Round Midnight Team
