"Follow Me" is another of our Theatre in Education performances that looks at extreme behaviour in young people's society. 

The 45 minute performance and follow on interactive workshop (suitable for ages 11-18) equips young people with the knowledge, understanding and awareness of push/pull factors and radicalisation. This program, particularly with what is in the news at the moment, is needed in schools and colleges more than ever.

So get in touch now to book these shows for your school!
