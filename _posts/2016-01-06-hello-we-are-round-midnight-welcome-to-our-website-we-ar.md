Hello, we are Round Midnight! Welcome to our website.

Round Midnight Ltd was established back in 1992 and its sister company Round Midnight Creative Arts (not for profit) was established in 2010\.

We specialise in drama in schools, performing arts, film and music but also provide visual arts and dance programmes. Our work includes Theatre in Education, a Radio 4 comedy series, a situation comedy, casting workshops and film coaching for the TV and film industry, numerous tours of theatres and comedy venues, school programmes, corporate training and much more.
